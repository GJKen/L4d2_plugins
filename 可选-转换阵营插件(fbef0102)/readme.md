# 中文說明
提供多種命令轉換隊伍陣營 (譬如: !afk, !survivors, !infected), 但不可濫用.

* 原理
	* 提供加入倖存者陣營的命令
	* 提供加入特感陣營的命令
	* 提供加入旁觀者陣營的命令
	* 此插件會控制玩家切換隊伍的行為包括
		1. 使用ESC->休息一下
		<br/>![POI)A31HUG3M(O (0IK`SY2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12229810/209460474-e795534e-335c-4cff-83e7-3a737ec0d47e.png)
		2. 對抗模式下按M切換隊伍
		<br/>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12229810/209460497-af899ea0-d670-4de8-9da9-e242eeae30e2.png)
		3. 控制台輸入```jointeam 2 <Nick|Ellis|Rochelle|Coach|Bill|Zoey|Francis|Louis>```
		<br/>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12229810/209460517-547fe0c9-eb9b-456c-8fc7-f72f2d70f59c.png)
		4. 控制台輸入```sb_takecontrol <Nick|Ellis|Rochelle|Coach|Bill|Zoey|Francis|Louis>```
		<br/>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12229810/209469875-f17e87bd-907a-4a64-b9b4-023bac157b13.png)
	* 此插件會禁止玩家濫用閒置的bug，譬如
		1. 導致witch失去目標
		2. 省略裝子彈時間
		3. 逃避特感抓住造成的傷害
		4. 特感故意切換旁觀省略下次的靈魂特感復活時間
		5. 死亡倖存者玩家跳隊重新拿到活著的倖存者Bot
		6. 遊戲開始後故意跳隊到對面擾亂對方隊伍
	* 盡量不要安裝其他也有換隊指令的插件，否則換隊衝突後果自負
	* 倖存者玩家如果要成為旁觀者而非閒置狀態可以輸入```!ob```

* 功能
	1. 可設置跳隊到倖存者、特感、旁觀的權限
	2. 可設置每個跳隊限制的功能開關與冷卻時間限制
	3. 可設置管理員不會受到此插件的換隊限制影響
	4. 可禁用ESC-休息一下
	5. 可禁用對抗模式下按M切換隊伍與控制台輸入```jointeam```
	6. 管理員可以輸入```sm_swapto <玩家名稱> <隊伍數字>```，強制該位玩家換到隊伍
		* 隊伍數字，請寫1或2或3，1為旁觀者, 2為倖存者, 3為特感
	7. 倖存者可以輸入```!zs```自殺，可以使用指令關閉這項功能

* 注意事項
	* 遊戲開始之後此插件才會生效
		* 離開安全區域或是生存模式計時開始
	* 有以下情況不能使用命令換隊，否則強制旁觀
		1. 嚇到Witch或者Witch正在攻擊你
			* 防止Witch失去目標
		2. 被特感抓住的期間
			* 防止濫用特感控了無傷
		3. 你已經是死亡的倖存者
			* 防止玩家故意死亡，然後跳隊
		4. 離開安全區域或是生存模式計時開始一段時間之後查看指令設置的時間)
		5. 換隊之後短時間內不能換第二次
			* 防止玩家頻繁換隊洗頻伺服器
		6. 點燃汽油桶、煤氣罐一段時間內
			* 防止友傷bug
			* 防止Witch失去目標
		7. 丟出火焰瓶、土製炸彈、膽汁瓶一段時間內
			* 防止友傷bug
			* 防止Witch失去目標
		8. 武器正在裝子彈
			* 防止快速隊伍切換省略裝彈時間
		9. 特感抓住倖存者的期間
			* 防止Jockey瞬移
			* 防止Ghost Charger的爭議
		10. 特感剛復活的時候
			* 防止切換特感
		11. 對抗/清道夫模式下檢查雙方隊伍的玩家數量，隊伍不平衡則不能換隊
			* 防止一方的玩家數量過多
		12. 起身或硬直狀態中禁止換隊
			* 防止略過硬直狀態
